### About Me

Hello and welcome to my professional nexus.

Having honed my skills with a Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Bangalore, my professional trajectory over the past three years has taken me through the nuanced terrains of Telecom, Retail, and Technology. Each domain presented its unique set of challenges. Yet, with a persistent focus on harnessing data-driven insights, I've consistently translated challenges into solutions and value propositions.

Presently, I'm deepening my expertise in the MS Analytics program at Georgia Tech. My specialization in Computational Data Analytics has been a rich learning ground. Here, I've bolstered my analytical capabilities and delved into pioneering research in Computer Vision. Moreover, I've embarked on practical projects, notably one that focuses on the riveting world of Generative AI.

### Research

[Agent-Based Modeling of Data Localization](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102022)

This agent-based model simulatees the trade of digital services between consumers and producers.
An augmented gravity trade model with various data regulatory constraints accounted for costs of the services. 
Additionally, The work was published as a dedicated chapter in [Data-centric Living: Algorithms, Digitization and Regulation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003093442-12) and was also cited by [United Nations Digital Economy Report 2021](https://unctad.org/webflyer/digital-economy-report-2021).

[Generation Of Realistic Vehicle Trajectories From Video Streams](/images/demo.gif?raw=true)

This was part of my research co-op in collaboration with Siemens Technology.
To facilitate the large-scale collection of realistic driving behavior data,  a Mask-RCNN-based object-detection framework is used to extract vehicle trajectories from traffic camera videos.  Furthermore,  deep learning models such as GANs and LSTMs are used to generate new trajectories.

### Projects
[Agent Based Modeling and Simulation Of Drug-Resistant Diseases](https://github.com/raks097/Agent-Based-Modeling-And-Simulation-of-Drug-Resistant-Diseases-)

This agent-based model was developed to study the onset of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The model uses RepastCity to simulate human movements on GIS-based urban enviroments and simulates subsequent spread of the disease.
Our model was able to implicate interesting findings such as differences between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible diseases.

[Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/raks097/nn_style_transfer)

Implementations of neural style transfer(NST) were developed to  compose images in the style of another image.
Different versions of the NST are implemented, such as the VGG19-based single style transfer and Segmentation style transfer
