### Research

## AI Forest: Cognition in the Wild
**Supervised by:** Dr. Jacob Abernethy, College of Computing, Georgia Tech & Dr. Marcela BenÃ­tez, Department of Anthropology, Emory University

- Deployed **YOLOv7** for primate identification within the AI Forest initiative, witnessing a substantial boost in accuracy rates â€” from 0.87 to 0.92, specifically for wild capuchin images.
- The ensuing phase is set to witness real-time deployment within a wildlife sanctuary located in Costa Rica, geared towards recognizing and tracking capuchin monkeys of identical species.
- This pioneering project has been honored with the esteemed **AI.Humanity seed grant** bestowed by both Georgia Tech and Emory University.

[Agent-Based Modeling of Data Localization](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102022)

This agent-based model simulatees the trade of digital services between consumers and producers.
An augmented gravity trade model with various data regulatory constraints accounted for costs of the services. 
Additionally, The work was published as a dedicated chapter in [Data-centric Living: Algorithms, Digitization and Regulation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003093442-12) and was also cited by [United Nations Digital Economy Report 2021](https://unctad.org/webflyer/digital-economy-report-2021).

[Generation Of Realistic Vehicle Trajectories From Video Streams](/images/demo.gif?raw=true)

This was part of my research co-op in collaboration with Siemens Technology.
To facilitate the large-scale collection of realistic driving behavior data,  a Mask-RCNN-based object-detection framework is used to extract vehicle trajectories from traffic camera videos.  Furthermore,  deep learning models such as GANs and LSTMs are used to generate new trajectories.

### Projects
[Agent Based Modeling and Simulation Of Drug-Resistant Diseases](https://github.com/raks097/Agent-Based-Modeling-And-Simulation-of-Drug-Resistant-Diseases-)

This agent-based model was developed to study the onset of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The model uses RepastCity to simulate human movements on GIS-based urban enviroments and simulates subsequent spread of the disease.
Our model was able to implicate interesting findings such as differences between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible diseases.

[Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/raks097/nn_style_transfer)

Implementations of neural style transfer(NST) were developed to  compose images in the style of another image.
Different versions of the NST are implemented, such as the VGG19-based single style transfer and Segmentation style transfer
