### About Me

Hello! Welcome to a snapshot of my professional journey.

Originating from a solid foundation with a Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Bangalore, I've dedicated over three years to navigating the intricate terrains of Telecom, Retail, and Technology. Each sector revealed its own unique challenges, but fortified with a commitment to data-driven insights, I consistently devised impactful solutions. From sharpening forecasting models in Retail to innovating with machine learning methodologies, my endeavors always centered around creating tangible value.

Presently, as I steer through the rigorous MS Analytics program at Georgia Tech, specializing in Computational Data Analytics, my experiences have been nothing short of transformative. My time here has not only deepened my analytical prowess but has also seen me embark on pioneering research in Computer Vision and a practical project focusing on Generative AI.

### Research

[Agent-Based Modeling of Data Localization](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102022)

This agent-based model simulatees the trade of digital services between consumers and producers.
An augmented gravity trade model with various data regulatory constraints accounted for costs of the services. 
Additionally, The work was published as a dedicated chapter in [Data-centric Living: Algorithms, Digitization and Regulation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003093442-12) and was also cited by [United Nations Digital Economy Report 2021](https://unctad.org/webflyer/digital-economy-report-2021).

[Generation Of Realistic Vehicle Trajectories From Video Streams](/images/demo.gif?raw=true)

This was part of my research co-op in collaboration with Siemens Technology.
To facilitate the large-scale collection of realistic driving behavior data,  a Mask-RCNN-based object-detection framework is used to extract vehicle trajectories from traffic camera videos.  Furthermore,  deep learning models such as GANs and LSTMs are used to generate new trajectories.

### Projects
[Agent Based Modeling and Simulation Of Drug-Resistant Diseases](https://github.com/raks097/Agent-Based-Modeling-And-Simulation-of-Drug-Resistant-Diseases-)

This agent-based model was developed to study the onset of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The model uses RepastCity to simulate human movements on GIS-based urban enviroments and simulates subsequent spread of the disease.
Our model was able to implicate interesting findings such as differences between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible diseases.

[Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/raks097/nn_style_transfer)

Implementations of neural style transfer(NST) were developed to  compose images in the style of another image.
Different versions of the NST are implemented, such as the VGG19-based single style transfer and Segmentation style transfer
