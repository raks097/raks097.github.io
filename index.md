### About me

I am Data Scientist/ML Engineer at Reliance Jio.  I graduated from the International Institute of Information Technology with an MTech in Computer Science and Engineering.
My current research is in Applied Data Science and Explainable AI. I am fascinated by the cross-disciplinary applications of AI/ML in fields such as economics, healthcare and telecommunications.

### Research

[Agent-Based Modeling of Data Localization](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102022)

This agent-based model simulatees the trade of digital services between consumers and producers.
An augmented gravity trade model with various data regulatory constraints accounted for costs of the services.
The work was published as a dedicated chapter in [Data-centric Living: Algorithms, Digitization and Regulation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003093442-12) and was also cited by [United Nations Digital Economy Report 2021](https://unctad.org/webflyer/digital-economy-report-2021).

[Generation Of Realistic Vehicle Trajectories From Video Streams]("/pdf/Siemens_Research.pdf")

This was part of the research conducted during my time at Siemens Technology.
To facilitate the large-scale collection of realistic driving behavior data,  a Mask-RCNN-based object-detection framework is used to extract vehicle trajectories from traffic camera videos.  Furthermore,  deep learning models such as GANs and LSTMs are used to generate new trajectories.
